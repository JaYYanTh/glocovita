the file contains some images , word documents and code of glucovita...

the images show u how our app interface looks after each click 

we made a word documnet representing each step explaing everything

at last u can copy the code and use if u want....


basic introduction about our project....

our project is "CREATING AN APP INTERFACE WHICH CAN COMMUNICATE WITH GLUCOMETRE VIA BLUETOOTH"

we used "FLUTTER" TO create this app interface
we used repository called flutter-blue-plus to connect the glucometre device and app interface
our project is not 100% succusful since flutter is updating dayby day... the syntaxes are changing with every update
